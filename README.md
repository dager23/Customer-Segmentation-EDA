I. Introduction

II. Background -
This project is about customer segmentation. Wherein, we divide the customers into segments based on their characteristics and apply a ‘personalized targeting’ technique to take the market to the customers effectively. The segments help us to optimize the significance of each customer to the business, hence modifying specific products and the market to the needs of the customer. Demographics, behaviour, benefit groups, social data of the customers and the value of the products are some of the ways which help segment customers effectively in the given data.

III . Motivation -
The motivation of Personalized targeting involves specific product data and behavioural characteristics to determine which group/segment of people increases or decreases the product value in the market, which group ensures more profit in a given time period and applying special strategies to increase sales in the respective sector. The segments also help us to get proper feedback on what the customers need and cater to their needs. These segments can be formed with the help of techniques like Statistical Analysis, Outlier Analysis, Clustering and Apriori algorithms 

IV. Statement- 
We have taken a groceries firm’s database wherein we are going to clean the data for anomalies, outliers and errors, pre-process it, reduce the dimensionality to get a detailed look of the sectors about to be grouped, creating segments from the behaviour, evaluate the clusters using visualization with certain criteria’s and pattern arrangement, profile the data and end with conclusions about each cluster we have. This entire process will give a solution to bring the products to the market by the needs of the customer, target the sales pitch on the required cluster and to cater to the needs of every cluster and their uses.

V. Challenges -
The challenges faced by author includes cleaning the data before being used for analysis, extracting features from the processed data necessary for analysis and reducing the dimensionality of data down to four important features . Analysing the final results to draw appropriate conclusions.
